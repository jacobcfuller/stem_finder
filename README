Program that finds stem loops based on following rules:


 Rule 1: substring length >= 12 and <=100
 Rule 2: A ‘GNRA’ motif is at the center of the subsequence
 Rule 3: The subsequence contains at least 4 pairs of complementary
         nucleotides.
 Rule 4: Each half of each complementary pair must be located equidistant from
         the center of the ‘GNRA’ motif as shown in the diagram of the hairpin
         structure above.
 Rule 5: Both nucleotides of one of the complementary pairs must be a distance
         of <= 2 from either end of the ‘GNRA’ motif
 Rule 6: At least 70% of nucleotides in a complementarity region must be
         participating in a pairing interaction.


Right now, only set up to take specific input. Will modify to take file from command line soon
